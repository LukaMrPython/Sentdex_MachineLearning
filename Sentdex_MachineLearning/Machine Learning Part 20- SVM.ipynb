    "- Seperate groups into one FROM the rest \n",
    "- The equation we need to solve is to get the sum of two vectors to seperate the vectors\n",
    "- So remember is to find the best seperating hyerplane can be calculated with the width of the best fits? /2 and you could get the hyperplanes\n",
    "\n",
    "### MIT OPENCOURSEWARE ADDED HERE\n",
    "- so you want to draw a line such that there is a seperation between -ve and postive tables\n",

    "THE DIFFERENCE\n",

    "2 / mag(W)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to maxmimize THIS constraint to make sure this will work, which is same as 1/mag(W} which means MINIMIZE mag(W)\n",
